title: Authentication
description: >-
  All requests to Datadog’s API must be authenticated.

  Requests that write data require reporting access and require an `API key`.

  Requests that read data require full access and also require an `application
  key`.


  **Note:** All Datadog API clients are configured by default to consume Datadog
  US site APIs.

  If you are on the Datadog EU site, set the environment variable `DATADOG_HOST`
  to

  `https://api.datadoghq.eu` or override this value directly when creating your
  client.

  keys](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api).


  ## Validate API key


  [See API version 1](/api/v1/authentication/#validate-api-key).
