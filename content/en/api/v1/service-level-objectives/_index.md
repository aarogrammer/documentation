  Objectives](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/service_level_objectives/#configuration)

  (or SLOs) are a key part of the site reliability engineering toolkit.

  SLOs provide a framework for defining clear targets around application
  performance,

  which ultimately help teams provide a consistent customer experience,

  balance feature development with platform stability,

  and improve communication with internal and external users.

  DeleteSLOTimeframeInBulk:
    description: >-
      Delete (or partially delete) multiple service level objective objects.


      This endpoint facilitates deletion of one or more thresholds for one or
      more

      service level objective objects. If all thresholds are deleted, the
      service level

      objective object is deleted as well.

          The bulk partial delete service level objective object endpoint
          response.

          This endpoint operates on multiple service level objective objects, so
          it may be partially successful. In such cases, the "data" and "error"
          fields in this response indicate which deletions succeeded and failed.

        schema_description: Error response object.
    request_description: Delete multiple service level objective objects request body.
    request_schema_description: |-
      A map of service level objective object IDs to arrays of timeframes,
      which indicate the thresholds to delete for each ID.
  CheckCanDeleteSLO:
    description: |-
      Check if a SLO can be safely deleted. For example,
      assure an SLO can be deleted without disrupting a dashboard.

    responses:
      '200':
        description: OK
        schema_description: A service level objective response containing the requested object.

        description: Bad Request
        schema_description: Error response object.
      '403':
        description: Forbidden
        schema_description: Error response object.

        description: Conflict
        schema_description: A service level objective response containing the requested object.
  DeleteSLO:
    description: |-
      Permanently delete the specified service level objective object.

      If an SLO is used in a dashboard, the `DELETE /v1/slo/` endpoint returns
      a 409 conflict error because the SLO is referenced in a dashboard.

      etc.).
  GetSLOHistory:
    description: >-
      Get a specific SLOâ€™s history, regardless of its SLO type.


      The detailed history data is structured according to the source data type.

      For example, metric data is included for event SLOs that use

      the metric source, and monitor SLO types include the monitor transition
      history.


      **Note:** There are different response formats for event based and time
      based SLOs.

      Examples of both are shown.
